    abstract 		= {Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models to learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram, words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.}

    abstract 		= {Many modern NLP systems rely on word embeddings, previously trained in an unsupervised manner on large corpora, as base features. Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as sentences, have however not been so successful. Several attempts at learning unsupervised representations of sentences have not reached satisfactory enough performance to be widely adopted. In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks. Our encoder is publicly available.}

	abstract 		= {We present an automatic approach to the construction of BabelNet, a very large, wide-coverage multilingual semantic network. Key to our approach is the integration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition, Machine Translation is applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We first conduct in vitro experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of BabelNet. We then show that our lexical resource can be used successfully to perform both monolingual and cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation: thanks to its wide lexical coverage and novel semantic relations, we are able to achieve state-of the-art results on three different SemEval evaluation tasks. },
